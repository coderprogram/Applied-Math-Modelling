# Mathematical Modeling in Python

Inspired by Giordano’s *A First Course in Mathematical Modeling*.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focused on practical, hands-on exploration of difference equations. Each notebook is organized by topic (e.g., population growth, finance, basic dynamical systems), and provides:

- Clean, well-commented Python code
- Editable parameter values for experimentation
- Automatic graphs to visualize model behavior

There are no long theory sections—just code and interactive plots designed for direct exploration.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/coderprogram/Applied-Math-Modelling.git
    cd your-repo
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
    ```
3. Launch Jupyter and open the notebooks:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or
    ```
    jupyter lab
    ```
